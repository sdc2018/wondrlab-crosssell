## Key Components

### Client Management
- **ClientList**: Displays a table of clients with filtering and sorting
- **ClientDetail**: Shows detailed client information, contacts, and services
- **ClientForm**: Form for adding/editing client information
- **ClientContactForm**: Form for managing client contacts

### Service Management
- **ServiceList**: Displays a table of services with filtering by BU
- **ServiceDetail**: Shows detailed service information
- **ServiceForm**: Form for adding/editing service information

### Cross-Sell Matrix
- **MatrixView**: The centerpiece of the application, showing clients vs. services
- **MatrixCell**: Individual cell component for the matrix
- **OpportunityModal**: Modal for creating/editing opportunities from the matrix

### Opportunity Management
- **OpportunityList**: Displays a table of opportunities with filtering and sorting
- **OpportunityDetail**: Shows detailed opportunity information and tasks
- **OpportunityForm**: Form for adding/editing opportunity information
- **StatusUpdateForm**: Form for updating opportunity status

### Task Management
- **TaskList**: Displays a table of tasks with filtering and sorting
- **TaskDetail**: Shows detailed task information
- **TaskForm**: Form for adding/editing task information
- **MyTasks**: Dashboard view of tasks assigned to the current user

### Reporting & Analytics
- **PipelineReport**: Displays opportunity pipeline by stage
- **WinLossReport**: Shows win/loss analysis
- **CoverageReport**: Displays client service coverage
- **ServicePenetrationReport**: Shows service adoption across clients
- **UserActivityReport**: Displays user performance metrics

## State Management
The application will use Redux or Context API for state management:

- **Authentication State**: User information, roles, and permissions
- **Client State**: Client list, selected client, client contacts
- **Service State**: Service list, services by BU
- **Opportunity State**: Opportunity list, selected opportunity, opportunity tasks
- **Task State**: Task list, my tasks, overdue tasks
- **UI State**: Loading states, error messages, modal visibility

## Routing Structure
```
/login                         # Login page
/dashboard                     # Overview dashboard
/clients                       # Client list
/clients/:id                   # Client detail
/services                      # Service list
/services/:id                  # Service detail
/matrix                        # Cross-sell matrix view
/opportunities                 # Opportunity list
/opportunities/:id             # Opportunity detail
/tasks                         # Task list
/my-tasks                      # Current user's tasks
/reports                       # Reporting dashboard
/reports/:reportType           # Specific report view
/admin                         # Admin settings (users, BUs, etc.)
```

## API Integration
The frontend will communicate with the backend API using Axios or Fetch API. API service functions will be organized by entity type (clients, services, opportunities, tasks) and will handle:

- CRUD operations for each entity
- Error handling and retry logic
- Authentication token management
- Request/response transformation

## User Interface Design
The UI will follow these principles:

- Clean, professional design suitable for enterprise use
- Responsive layout for desktop and tablet (mobile as future enhancement)
- Consistent color coding for opportunity statuses
- Intuitive navigation with sidebar and breadcrumbs
- Clear visual hierarchy and typography
- Accessible design following WCAG guidelines

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (Admin, Sales, BU Head, Senior Management)
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Session management and token refresh

## Error Handling
- Centralized error handling for API requests
- User-friendly error messages
- Form validation with immediate feedback
- Fallback UI for failed data loading

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of routes and components
- Pagination for large data sets
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
- Debouncing for search inputs

## Implementation Plan
1. Set up project structure and core dependencies
2. Implement authentication and basic routing
3. Create reusable UI components
4. Implement client and service management features
5. Develop the cross-sell matrix view
6. Add opportunity and task management
7. Implement reporting and analytics
8. Finalize styling and responsive design
9. Comprehensive testing and bug fixing
10. Performance optimization

## Alignment with PRD Requirements
The frontend architecture is designed to fulfill all the requirements specified in the PRD:

- **Centralize Cross-Sell Data**: The matrix view provides a single view of all clients and services
- **Identify Opportunities**: The matrix interface highlights potential cross-sell opportunities
- **Streamline Collaboration**: Opportunity management features allow assignment and tracking
- **Track Progress & Notify**: Task management and status updates keep everyone informed
- **Inform Strategy with Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics features
- **Ensure Usability & Adoption**: Intuitive UI with familiar patterns and minimal training needed
- **Plan for Scale & Security**: Role-based access and optimized performance for growing data
