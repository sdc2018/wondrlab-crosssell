# Wondrlab Cross-Sell Opportunity Management System - Architecture Document

## Current Project State

### Backend Architecture
The backend is implemented as a Node.js application with Express and TypeScript, using PostgreSQL as the database with TypeORM for object-relational mapping.

**Key Backend Components:**
1. **Server Entry Points**:
   - `server/src/index.ts` - Main server application
   - `server/src/seed.ts` - Database seeding script

2. **Database Configuration**:
   - `server/src/config/database.ts`

3. **Data Models**:
   - `server/src/models/Client.ts` - Client information
   - `server/src/models/ClientContact.ts` - Contact information for clients
   - `server/src/models/Service.ts` - Service offerings
   - `server/src/models/BusinessUnit.ts` - Business units within the organization
   - `server/src/models/Opportunity.ts` - Cross-selling opportunities
   - `server/src/models/Task.ts` - Tasks associated with opportunities
   - `server/src/models/Engagement.ts` - Client engagements
   - `server/src/models/Note.ts` - Notes related to clients/opportunities
   - `server/src/models/User.ts` - User information

4. **Backend Dependencies**:
   - Express.js for API routing
   - TypeORM for database operations
   - PostgreSQL as the database
   - JWT and bcrypt for authentication
   - Helmet and CORS for security
   - TypeScript for type safety

### Frontend Architecture (Intended Design)
The README.md describes a React TypeScript frontend that doesn't appear to be fully implemented yet. Here's the intended architecture:

**Technology Stack:**
- React with TypeScript
- Material-UI (MUI) for UI components
- React Hooks for state management
- React Router for navigation
- MUI components for data visualization

**Intended Directory Structure:**
```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable components
│   ├── clients/        # Client-related components
│   ├── opportunities/  # Opportunity-related components
│   ├── services/       # Service-related components
│   └── common/         # Common UI components
├── pages/              # Page components
│   ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard page
│   ├── clients/        # Client management pages
│   ├── services/       # Service catalog pages
│   ├── matrix/         # Cross-sell matrix pages
│   └── opportunities/  # Opportunity management pages
├── models/             # TypeScript interfaces
├── services/           # API services
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── App.tsx             # Main App component
└── index.tsx           # Entry point
```

**Key Frontend Features (Planned):**
1. **Cross-Sell Matrix** - Interactive grid view showing clients vs. services
2. **Client Management** - Comprehensive client information management
3. **Service Catalog** - Business Unit service offerings management
4. **Opportunity Management** - End-to-end tracking of cross-selling opportunities
5. **Task Management** - Assignment and tracking of tasks
6. **Dashboard** - Personalized overview with KPIs and activity feeds
7. **Import/Export** - CSV data import/export functionality

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Status
The project appears to be in an early development phase with:
- A well-structured backend implementation using TypeScript, Express, and TypeORM
- Data models that align with the business requirements described in the README
- An intended frontend architecture that follows React best practices but doesn't appear to be implemented yet

### Recommendations for Frontend Implementation
When implementing the frontend as described in the README:

1. **State Management**:
   - Use React Context API and hooks for simpler state requirements
   - Consider Redux or MobX for more complex state management if needed

2. **API Integration**:
   - Create service classes for API communication with the backend
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states

3. **Component Design**:
   - Follow the component hierarchy described in the README
   - Create reusable components in the common directory
   - Implement feature-specific components in their respective directories

4. **Routing**:
   - Use React Router with a route configuration that matches the pages structure
   - Implement protected routes for authenticated areas

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use MUI components for the cross-sell matrix and dashboard visualizations
   - Consider additional libraries like recharts or nivo for more complex visualizations

This document should serve as a guide for both developers and AI tools to understand the current state and intended architecture of the Wondrlab Cross-Sell Opportunity Management System.
