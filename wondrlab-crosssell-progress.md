Created utility functions in `importExport.ts`:
- `exportToCSV`: Converts an array of entities to CSV format
- `downloadCSV`: Triggers a download of data as a CSV file
- `parseCSV`: Parses CSV content to an array of objects
- `readCSVFile`: Reads a CSV file and returns its content
- `validateImportData`: Validates imported data against a schema

### 3. Backend API Implementation
#### 3.1 Client Management
- Created `ClientService` with comprehensive business logic for client operations
- Implemented `ClientController` with proper error handling for HTTP requests

- Added routes to main router in `index.ts`

#### 3.2 Opportunity Management
- Created `OpportunityService` with business logic for cross-sell opportunities
- Implemented `OpportunityController` with proper error handling
- Defined RESTful API routes for opportunity operations in `opportunityRoutes.ts`
- Added specialized endpoints for filtering opportunities by client and business unit
- Added routes to main router in `index.ts`

#### 3.3 Business Unit Management
- Created `BusinessUnitService` with business logic for business unit operations
- Implemented `BusinessUnitController` with proper error handling
- Defined RESTful API routes for business unit operations in `businessUnitRoutes.ts`
- Added specialized endpoints for retrieving services and opportunities by business unit
- Added routes to main router in `index.ts`

#### 3.4 Service Management
- Created `ServiceService` with business logic for service operations
- Implemented `ServiceController` with proper error handling

- Added specialized endpoints for filtering services by business unit, category, and active status
- Added routes to main router in `index.ts`

#### 3.5 Sample Data Generation
- Created seed script (`seed.ts`) to populate the database with sample data
- Added sample data for Business Units, Services, Clients, and Opportunities
- Implemented realistic relationships between entities for testing cross-sell functionality

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- Created `User` model with role-based access control (admin, sales, bu_head, management)
- Implemented `UserService` with authentication and JWT functionality
- Created `UserController` with registration and login endpoints
- Developed comprehensive `AuthMiddleware` for protecting routes
- Added role-based middleware (isAdmin, isBusinessUnitHead, isManagement)
- Implemented resource-based authorization (isSelf, isSelfOrAdmin, isSameBusinessUnit)
- Applied authentication to all API routes with appropriate access controls
- Added user routes to main router in `index.ts`

### 5. Cross-Sell Matrix Functionality
- Created `CrossSellMatrixService` with comprehensive business logic for cross-sell analysis
- Implemented opportunity scoring algorithm based on multiple factors
- Created `CrossSellMatrixController` with proper error handling
- Defined RESTful API routes for cross-sell matrix operations in `crossSellMatrixRoutes.ts`
- Added specialized endpoints for filtering matrix data by client, business unit, industry, and region
- Implemented high-opportunity cross-sell identification
- Applied proper authentication and authorization to matrix routes
- Added cross-sell matrix routes to main router in `index.ts`
