# Wondrlab Cross-Selling Management System - Progress Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on implementing import/export functionality for the Wondrlab Cross-Selling Management System. The system is designed to centralize client, service, and opportunity data to facilitate cross-selling across different Business Units (BUs).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. TypeScript Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors in various components that were preventing compilation
- Resolved type mismatches between interfaces
- Fixed issues with Grid components and their props
- Updated component props to match their interfaces

### 2. Import/Export Utilities
Created utility functions in `importExport.ts`:
- `exportToCSV`: Converts an array of entities to CSV format
- `downloadCSV`: Triggers a download of data as a CSV file
- `parseCSV`: Parses CSV content to an array of objects
- `readCSVFile`: Reads a CSV file and returns its content
- `validateImportData`: Validates imported data against a schema

### 3. Reusable Components
Created a reusable `ImportExportButtons` component that provides:
- Export button to download entity data as CSV
- Import button with a dialog for uploading CSV files
- Validation of imported data
- Error handling and user feedback

### 4. Entity Page Integration
Integrated import/export functionality into the following entity pages:

#### Clients Page (`ClientList.tsx`)
- Added ImportExportButtons to the header
- Implemented `handleImportClients` function
- Added validation for required fields
- Added custom validators for Industry and Region fields

#### Services Page (`ServiceList.tsx`)
- Added ImportExportButtons to the header
- Implemented `handleImportServices` function
- Added validation for required fields (Name, AssociatedBU_ID)
- Added custom validators for IsActive field

#### Users Page (`UserList.tsx`)
- Added ImportExportButtons to the header
- Implemented `handleImportUsers` function
- Added validation for required fields (Name, Email, Role)
- Added custom validators for Email, Role, and IsActive fields
- Implemented role-based access control using ProtectedRoute

### 5. Service Files
Updated or created service files:
- Updated `userService.ts` to use the correct User interface
- Implemented CRUD operations for users

### 6. Sample Data
Leveraged existing sample data files:
- `sampleBusinessUnits.ts`
- `sampleClients.ts`
- `sampleServices.ts`
- `sampleUsers.ts`
- `sampleOpportunities.ts`

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Opportunities Page
- Implement import/export functionality for the Opportunities page
- Add validation for required fields
- Add custom validators for specific fields

### 2. Testing
- Test import/export functionality across all entity pages
- Verify validation works correctly
- Ensure error handling provides useful feedback

### 3. Documentation
- Add comments to explain complex logic
- Update README with information about import/export functionality
- Create user documentation on how to use the import/export features

## Technical Details

### Import/Export Flow
1. **Export**:
   - User clicks Export button
   - Data is converted to CSV format
   - CSV file is downloaded to the user's device

2. **Import**:
   - User clicks Import button
   - Import dialog opens
   - User uploads a CSV file
   - File is parsed and validated
   - If validation passes, data is processed
   - Existing records are updated, new records are created
   - User receives success/error feedback

### Validation Rules
- **Clients**:
  - Required: Name
  - Industry must be from a predefined list
  - Region must be from a predefined list

- **Services**:
  - Required: Name, AssociatedBU_ID
  - IsActive must be a boolean value

- **Users**:
  - Required: Name, Email, Role
  - Email must be a valid email format
  - Role must be from the UserRole enum
  - IsActive must be a boolean value

### Security Considerations
- User management is restricted to System Administrators
- Import/export functionality respects the same access controls as the rest of the application

## Next Steps
When work resumes, we'll continue by:
1. Locating or creating the OpportunityList.tsx file
2. Implementing import/export functionality following the same pattern used for other entity pages
3. Testing the complete import/export functionality across all entity types
4. Addressing any remaining TypeScript warnings or issues
