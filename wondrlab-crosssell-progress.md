Created utility functions in `importExport.ts`:
- `exportToCSV`: Converts an array of entities to CSV format
- `downloadCSV`: Triggers a download of data as a CSV file
- `parseCSV`: Parses CSV content to an array of objects
- `readCSVFile`: Reads a CSV file and returns its content
- `validateImportData`: Validates imported data against a schema

### 3. Backend API Implementation
- Created RESTful API endpoints for all entities
- Implemented authentication and authorization middleware
