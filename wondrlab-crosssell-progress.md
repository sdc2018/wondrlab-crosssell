# Wondrlab Cross-Sell Management System - Progress Report

## Project Overview
The Wondrlab Cross-Sell Management System is a web application designed to help sales teams manage cross-selling opportunities across different clients and services. The system consists of a React-based frontend and a planned backend API.

## Current Status

### Client-Side (Frontend)
- **Components**: Basic UI components have been implemented, including CrossSellMatrix, login forms, and various list views.
- **Testing**: 
  - Fixed circular dependency issues in sample data files
  - Created API service module with necessary functions
  - Created types file with required enums and interfaces
  - Created CrossSellMatrix component
  - Client-side tests are still failing due to:
    - Missing AuthContext module
    - App.test.tsx looking for text that doesn't exist in the current App component
- **Application Setup**:
  - Successfully installed react-scripts as a dev dependency
  - Added standard Create React App scripts to package.json:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "react-scripts start",
      "build": "react-scripts build",
      "test": "jest",
      "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    }
    ```
  - Successfully started the development server with `npm start`
  - Application can now be accessed at http://localhost:3001
- **Compilation Errors Fixed**:
  - Installed missing web-vitals package
  - Created sampleOpportunities.ts file with necessary exports:
    - OpportunityStatus and OpportunityPriority enums
    - Opportunity interface
    - Sample opportunity data
    - Utility functions for retrieving and filtering opportunities
  - Application now compiles and runs successfully

### Server-Side (Backend)
- **Status**: Server-side code has not been implemented yet
  - The server directory exists but is empty
  - No JavaScript or TypeScript files found outside of the client directory
  - No server-side tests found (as there is no server code to test)

## Next Steps

### Client-Side (Frontend)
1. Create the missing AuthContext module
2. Update the App.test.tsx to test for text that actually exists in the App component
3. Fix any remaining issues with client-side tests
4. Implement any missing client-side functionality
5. Test the application functionality through the UI

### Server-Side (Backend)
1. Implement the server-side API using Node.js/Express or another suitable framework
2. Create database models and controllers
3. Implement authentication and authorization
4. Write server-side tests for the API endpoints
5. Connect the client-side to the server-side API

## Issues and Challenges
- Circular dependencies in the sample data files were causing tests to hang indefinitely
- Missing modules and components needed for tests to pass
- Package.json was missing standard Create React App scripts, which had to be added manually
- Missing dependencies (web-vitals) and exports in sample data files caused compilation errors
- Server-side implementation is pending

## Conclusion
The client-side of the application has made significant progress. We've fixed circular dependencies in the sample data files, created necessary modules, and set up the development environment to run the application. The application now compiles and runs successfully, and can be accessed through a web browser at http://localhost:3001. There are still issues with the tests that need to be resolved, and the server-side implementation is pending and will be the next major phase of development.
